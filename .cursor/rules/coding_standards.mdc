description: Enforces coding standards and conventions for Rust backend and TypeScript/React/Next.js frontend. Includes async patterns, error handling, testing, and commit style guidelines.

# Coding Standards (Rust + TS/React/Next.js)

## Rust
- Use `tokio` for async.
- Use `anyhow`, `thiserror` for errors.
- Use `sqlx` for DB with compile-time checks.
- All crates must expose clean modules, no circular deps.
- Workers must never panic during node execution.
- All Node ABI structs must derive `Serialize` + `Deserialize`.

## Next.js + React
- Use React Flow for editor.
- Use Server Actions for backend calls.
- Use TypeScript everywhere.
- Editor nodes must use the GenericNode component structure.

## Commit Style
- Conventional Commits:
  - feat:
  - fix:
  - refactor:
  - chore:
  - docs:

## Tests
- Rust: unit tests inside each crate/tests
- Next.js: Playwright for editor, Jest for utils
