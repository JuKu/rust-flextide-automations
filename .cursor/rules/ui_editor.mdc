# UI Editor Rules – React Flow Blueprint System

Editor uses React Flow with custom node renderer (GenericNode).

Rules:
- Inputs appear on the left side.
- Outputs appear on the right side.
- Exec-In on top.
- Exec-Out on bottom.
- Config pins also bottom.
- Nodes must never render random HTML; use consistent structure.

Connection Validation:
- Only allow connections where pin types match.
- Exec → Exec only.
- Data pins must match allowed types (see node_system.mdc).

Graph Export:
- Editor exports workflow JSON matching Core schema.
- Node position stored as x/y.
- Edge IDs encoded as `${nodeId}:${pinId}`.
- Nodes can have configuration and authentication data (e.q. credentialID), which have to be stored too.
