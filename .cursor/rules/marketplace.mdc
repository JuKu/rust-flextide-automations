# Node Marketplace Rules

Node Packs are zip files:

mypack-1.0.0.zip
  /pack.json
  /nodes/
      /nodeName/
         index.js or index.ts or node.wasm
         schema.json
         manifest.json
  /icons/
  /docs/

Marketplace API:
- POST /marketplace/packs/upload
- POST /marketplace/packs/publish
- GET /marketplace/packs
- GET /marketplace/packs/:id
- POST /install/:packId

Security:
- All Packs are validated before storage.
- Node files must declare NodeSpec in manifest.
- No JS Node may use eval, fetch, or imports unless allowed.
- WASM Nodes must declare required capabilities.

Pricing:
- Node Pack authors can sell packs.
- Billing via Stripe or other payment providers.
